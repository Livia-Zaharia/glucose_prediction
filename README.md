# glucose_prediction
Combining of all the repos used for this task
A work in progress repo to find glucose prediction based o CGM data
Users should read the ReadMe files from each repo

1. First use basecolor branch from [glucose](https://github.com/Livia-Zaharia/glucose/tree/basecolor)


2. Run the code there with values exported from Dexcom G6 sensor in csv format.
   Similar data with which to run glucose provided in DATA folder from this repo (glucose prediction)


3.Use latest branch from [tensorflow-test](https://github.com/Livia-Zaharia/tensorflow-test)

NOTE: this is still a work in progress repo so it might not be stable
      It uses tensorflow GPU
      You might use it to test using the images in DATA folder from tensorflow-test repo




At the moment looking to test data from (glucose prediction) using this repo [gulcoBench](https://github.com/IrinaStatsLab/GlucoBench) which is available for testing
